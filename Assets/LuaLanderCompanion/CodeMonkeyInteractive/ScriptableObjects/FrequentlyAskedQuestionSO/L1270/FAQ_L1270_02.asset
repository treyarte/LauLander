  title: Can I use ScriptableObjects to store changing data like player score or
    health?
  text: "You technically can, but it's not recommended. ScriptableObjects are best
    used for static data. In this course, we treat them as read-only data containers,
    and that\u2019s the cleanest use case\u2014especially when you want to ensure
    consistency across prefabs, levels, and logic."
