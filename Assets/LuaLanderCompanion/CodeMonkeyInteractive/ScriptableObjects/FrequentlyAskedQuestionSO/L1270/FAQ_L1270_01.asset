  title: What exactly is a ScriptableObject, and why is it better than using a regular
    C# class here?
  text: A ScriptableObject is a Unity asset that holds data. It exists in the project
    files and is reusable across scenes and objects. In this lecture, we used it
    to define cargo types (like crate or red key) to cleanly manage game data without
    hardcoding or duplicating info in multiple places.
