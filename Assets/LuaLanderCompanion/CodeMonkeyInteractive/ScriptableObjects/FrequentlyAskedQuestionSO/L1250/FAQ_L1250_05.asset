  title: Why did we use `AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint()` for pickups but not for looping
    sounds like the thruster or music?
  text: "`PlayClipAtPoint()` is great for short, one-shot sounds like pickups or
    collisions. For looping or continuous sounds, like thrusters or music, it\u2019s
    better to use an `AudioSource` component that you can start, stop, and manage
    dynamically."
