  title: Why are we using Unity 6.1 instead of Unity 6.0?
  text: Either one of those versions would be good, 6.1 is in Supported and 6.0 is
    in LTS which means both are perfectly stable and fine for building games in production.
    I chose 6.1 just because it's newer but 6.0 would have worked as well.
