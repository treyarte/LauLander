  title: Why not just zoom out permanently instead of zooming in after the start?
  text: "Because then the player would see too much and lose focus. Zooming in creates
    a tighter gameplay experience, while zooming out at the start gives a nice overview
    for planning. It\u2019s the best of both worlds."
