  title: Do we need to unsubscribe from the events?
  text: If the listener object has a shorter lifecycle than the publisher then yes,
    otherwise the publisher will be sending out events that will be listened by a
    null object. However if both live for the same amount of time, like in this case
    how both objects will stay alive for the whole game, then you don't need to unsubscribe
    since when the publisher dies, the listener dies as well.
