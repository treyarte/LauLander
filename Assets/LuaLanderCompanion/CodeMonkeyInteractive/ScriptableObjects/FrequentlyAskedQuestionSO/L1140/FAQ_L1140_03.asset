  title: "Couldn\u2019t we just directly tell the visual script to turn on the thruster
    from the logic script?"
  text: "Technically yes, but that\u2019s tightly coupling the two systems. If you
    remove the visuals or change the structure, your logic breaks. Using events decouples
    the two, the logic says \u201Cthis happened,\u201D and anything interested can
    react without the original script even knowing about it."
