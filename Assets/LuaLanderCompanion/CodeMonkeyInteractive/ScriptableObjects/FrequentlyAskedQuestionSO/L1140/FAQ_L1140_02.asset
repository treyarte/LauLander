  title: Why did we use events to trigger visual feedback?
  text: "Events let us send out signals (like \u201Cthrust up was pressed\u201D)
    without knowing or caring who\u2019s listening. This keeps the gameplay logic
    clean and completely unaware of any visual implementation, awesome for maintainability
    and code decoupling."
