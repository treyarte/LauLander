  title: "What\u2019s the difference between `Keyboard.current.upArrowKey.isPressed`
    and `Input.GetKey(KeyCode.UpArrow)`?"
  text: They do the same thing, check if the key is being held down, but they belong
    to different systems. The first is from the new Input System, the second is from
    the old legacy Input Manager.
