  title: How is score given after delivery?
  text: "There\u2019s a `GameLevelScripting_Level1.cs` script that listens to the
    `OnDroppedOff` event and rewards a bonus score (+1000) when the crate is successfully
    delivered. This method is how you can add all kinds of level specific scripting
    logic."
