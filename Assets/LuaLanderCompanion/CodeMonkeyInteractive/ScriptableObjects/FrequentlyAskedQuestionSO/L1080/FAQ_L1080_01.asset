  title: What is SpriteShape and why are we using it for terrain?
  text: SpriteShape is a 2D Unity tool that lets you draw and shape terrain using
    splines. You define any shape you want, and the tool builds the visuals around
    it. We're using it because it's super flexible and perfect for weird moon-like
    terrain.
