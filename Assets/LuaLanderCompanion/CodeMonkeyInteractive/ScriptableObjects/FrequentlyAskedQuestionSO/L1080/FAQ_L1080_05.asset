  title: "What\u2019s the difference between the Fill and Border in a SpriteShape
    Profile?"
  text: The Fill is the inside of your shape (the main texture), and the Border is
    for the edges. You can use both for effects like grassy tops and rocky sides.
    In this case, we removed the border to keep things simple.
