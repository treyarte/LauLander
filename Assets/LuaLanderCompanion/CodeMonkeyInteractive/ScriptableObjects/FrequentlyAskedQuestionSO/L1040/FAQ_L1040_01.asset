  title: Do I have to download the project files or can I just follow along manually?
  text: You technically *can* follow along manually, but I *highly* recommend downloading
    the project files. It ensures you have the exact same setup as me. Same Unity
    version, same URP pipeline, same packages, which avoids a ton of version-related
    confusion.
