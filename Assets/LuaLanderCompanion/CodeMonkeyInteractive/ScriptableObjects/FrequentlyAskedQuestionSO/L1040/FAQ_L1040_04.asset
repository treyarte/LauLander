  title: Will the knowledge I gain here still apply to other Unity versions in the
    future?
  text: Yes! Everything we do here is based on core Unity concepts that are consistent
    across versions. Once you finish the course, feel free to use any Unity version
    for your own projects and you will see how all your knowledge will transfer over
    to any version.
