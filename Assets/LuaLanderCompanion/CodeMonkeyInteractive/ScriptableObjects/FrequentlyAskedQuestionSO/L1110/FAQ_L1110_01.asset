  title: "Why isn\u2019t OnCollisionEnter2D being triggered?"
  text: Most likely you're mixing 2D and 3D components. Make sure you're using 2D
    colliders and a Rigidbody2D, not 3D versions. Also, confirm both objects have
    colliders and at least one has a Rigidbody2D. If there are no Rigidbodies involved
    in the collision at all then the functions don't fire.
