  title: Could we have used code instead of animation to move the asteroids?
  text: Yup! Using `Transform.position` in `Update()` or `FixedUpdate()` would work.
    But for this use case, animation is easier to visualize and adjust in the editor,
    especially when multiple asteroids are involved.
