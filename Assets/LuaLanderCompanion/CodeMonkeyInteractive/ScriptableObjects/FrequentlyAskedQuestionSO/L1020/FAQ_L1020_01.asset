  title: "What\u2019s the difference between a GameObject and a Component?"
  text: "A GameObject is like an empty container or shell. Components are what actually
    give it functionality. For example, a GameObject with a Camera component becomes
    a camera. Without any components, a GameObject doesn\u2019t really do anything."
