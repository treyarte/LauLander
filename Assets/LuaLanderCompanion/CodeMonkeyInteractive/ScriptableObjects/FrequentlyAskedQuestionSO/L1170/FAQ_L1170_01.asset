  title: Why does my UI look different at different resolutions?
  text: "It\u2019s most likely because your Canvas Scaler is not set to scale properly.
    Make sure your Canvas has a `Canvas Scaler` component, and set it to **Scale
    With Screen Size**. I personally prefer using 1920x1080 as the reference resolution
    and matching with the height. That way, things stay nicely positioned across
    different screen shapes."
