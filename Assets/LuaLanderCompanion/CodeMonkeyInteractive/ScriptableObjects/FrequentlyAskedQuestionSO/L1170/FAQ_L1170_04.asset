  title: Should I update UI in `Update()` or somewhere else?
  text: "For constantly changing values (like time, velocity, or fuel), `Update()`
    is fine. Just make sure it\u2019s lightweight, avoid complex calculations every
    frame. For values that change less often (like health or score), you could also
    trigger UI updates from events for better performance."
