  title: "How does anchoring work in Unity\u2019s UI system?"
  text: "Anchoring defines what part of the screen a UI element is \u201Cattached\u201D
    to. If you anchor it to the top-left, it will always stay in that spot even as
    screen size changes. If it\u2019s anchored to the center, it stays centered.
    Combine this with the Rect Transform and you can build super responsive UIs."
