  title: What is a Singleton and why use it here?
  text: "A Singleton is a pattern that provides global access to a single instance
    of a class. In this case, we use it for the Lander because there\u2019s only
    ever one. It simplifies access to the Lander from other scripts like the GameManager
    without manually dragging references around."
