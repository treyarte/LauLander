  title: Why not just use `Input.GetKey()` for the whole game?
  text: '`Input.GetKey()` is part of the legacy Input Manager which is great for
    prototyping and simple projects. But for anything beyond that, like adding gamepad
    or touch support, it becomes a mess. Refactoring to the Input System makes your
    input handling cleaner and future-proof.'
