  title: What does generating the C# class for the Input Actions actually do?
  text: It creates a strong-typed class based on your action maps and actions that
    does NOT rely on strings. So instead of dealing with fragile strings like "Player/Jump",
    you can access it like `inputActions.Player.Jump`. Much cleaner and way less
    error-prone.
