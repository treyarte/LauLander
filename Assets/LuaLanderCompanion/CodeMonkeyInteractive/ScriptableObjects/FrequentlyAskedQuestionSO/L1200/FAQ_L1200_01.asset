  title: Why use prefabs instead of separate scenes for each level?
  text: "Prefabs allow for faster iteration and fewer scene loads. They\u2019re easier
    to manage for smaller games like this, and keep all UI and core components in
    a single scene. Although the multi-scene method also works fine, just personal
    preference."
