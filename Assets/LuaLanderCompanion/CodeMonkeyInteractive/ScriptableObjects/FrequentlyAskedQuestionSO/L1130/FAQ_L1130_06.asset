  title: What if I want the multiplier text to update during runtime (not just in
    Awake)?
  text: In that case, move the update logic into a method you can call from outside,
    and trigger it whenever the multiplier changes. For this project though, since
    the multiplier is static, `Awake()` is perfect.
