  title: What happens if I don't use `Time.deltaTime`?
  text: Your game will behave differently depending on the framerate. On high FPS,
    everything might move super fast. On low FPS, things crawl. You want movement
    to be smooth and consistent, so always multiply your movement or forces by `deltaTime`.
    That said, if you're writing movement code in `FixedUpdate`, you technically
    don't need it since `FixedUpdate` already runs at a fixed rate. But if you're
    writing movement code in `Update`, always use `Time.deltaTime`.
