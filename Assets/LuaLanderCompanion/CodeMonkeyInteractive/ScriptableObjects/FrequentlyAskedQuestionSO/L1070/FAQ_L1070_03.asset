  title: Can I just use `Update()` for physics if it works?
  text: "Technically you can, but you shouldn't. Physics code should go in `FixedUpdate()`
    because it's synced with Unity's internal physics calculations. If you do it
    in `Update()`, physics might behave inconsistently. That said, if you're just
    setting `rigidbody2D.velocity` (not using `AddForce()`), it's fine to do that
    in `Update()` since it doesn't immediately move the physics object\u2014it just
    sets velocity for the next physics step."
