  question: What is the main issue with music restarting on each level load, and
    how is it fixed?
  optionList:
  - "The music volume resets \u2014 fixed by increasing gain"
  - "The pitch changes \u2014 fixed by restarting the audio source"
  - "The time resets \u2014 fixed by saving `AudioSource.time` in a static variable
    and restoring it"
  - "Music crashes \u2014 fixed by unloading scenes"
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: When the object is created, by default it will start playing from 0, so
    we need to keep the last time in order to correctly re-set it.
