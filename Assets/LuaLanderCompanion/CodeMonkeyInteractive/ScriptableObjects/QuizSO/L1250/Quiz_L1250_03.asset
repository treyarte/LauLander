  question: Why is the thruster sound handled with an `AudioSource` instead of `PlayClipAtPoint()`?
  optionList:
  - Because looping sounds can't be used with `PlayClipAtPoint()`
  - Because `PlayClipAtPoint()` is too loud
  - To avoid using the Input System
  - Because it's the only way to play stereo sound
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: The Thruster audio is meant to be continuous instead of one-shot so we
    handle it differently.
