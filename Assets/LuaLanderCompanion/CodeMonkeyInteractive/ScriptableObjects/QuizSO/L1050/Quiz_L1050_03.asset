  question: What is the consequence of mixing 2D and 3D physics components in Unity?
  optionList:
  - "The game won\u2019t compile"
  - The camera stops rendering
  - The components work fine together
  - The objects will not interact properly and collisions will fail
  correctOptionIndex: 3
  answer: "Unity's 2D and 3D physics systems are completely separate, they don\u2019t
    communicate. If you mix them, things like collisions just won\u2019t happen."
