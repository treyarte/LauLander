  question: Which component is used to give an object a physical shape for collision
    detection in Unity?
  optionList:
  - Sprite Renderer
  - Rigidbody
  - Collider (BoxCollider2D)
  - AudioSource
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Rigidbody gives movement and physics, but the **BoxCollider2D** defines
    the shape that interacts with other colliders. Again, don't mistakenly use a
    3D collider.
