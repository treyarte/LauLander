  question: Why is using tags to identify GameObjects not recommended?
  optionList:
  - Tags cannot be changed at runtime
  - Tags rely on strings, which are prone to human error
  - Tags can only be used in 3D scenes
  - Tags slow down your game
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: Just like names, tags are string-based. Any typo, casing difference, or
    missing assignment breaks functionality, making them unreliable identifiers.
