  question: What is the main reason you should avoid using `gameObject.name` to identify
    objects?
  optionList:
  - It increases performance overhead
  - String comparisons are brittle and error-prone
  - It's deprecated in Unity
  - It works only with 3D objects
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: "String comparisons are fragile \u2014 even a single space or typo breaks
    the logic. Object references are much more robust."
