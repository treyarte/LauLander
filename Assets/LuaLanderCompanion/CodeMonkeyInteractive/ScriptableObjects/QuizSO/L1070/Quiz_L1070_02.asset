  question: What's the correct way to apply a force in the direction the lander is
    facing?
  optionList:
  - '`Vector3.up`'
  - '`transform.forward`'
  - '`new Vector3(0, 1, 0)`'
  - '`transform.up`'
  correctOptionIndex: 3
  answer: '`transform.up` gives you the "up" direction relative to the object''s
    rotation. So as the lander rotates, it still thrusts in its up direction, exactly
    what we want.'
