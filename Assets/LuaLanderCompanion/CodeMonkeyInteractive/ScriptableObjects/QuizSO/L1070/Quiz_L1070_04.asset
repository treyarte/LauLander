  question: What's wrong with using a magic number like `700f` directly in your code?
  optionList:
  - It causes a compiler error
  - It makes the game run slower
  - It makes the code hard to read and understand
  - It's not compatible with Unity physics
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: "Magic numbers have hidden meaning. If you just see `700f` in code, it\u2019s
    not clear *what* it represents. By using a named variable like `force`, your
    code becomes much more readable."
