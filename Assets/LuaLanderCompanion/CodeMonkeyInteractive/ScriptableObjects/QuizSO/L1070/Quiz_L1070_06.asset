  question: Why do we assign the Rigidbody in `Awake()` instead of `Update()`?
  optionList:
  - Because Awake only runs once
  - Because Rigidbody must be assigned in the inspector
  - Update can't access components
  - To avoid using Generics
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: Calling `GetComponent` inside `Update()` means it's running every frame
    which is needlessly wasteful. Doing it once in `Awake()` is much cleaner and
    more efficient.
