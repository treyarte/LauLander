  question: "What happens if you try to access `scoreMultiplier` from another class
    while it\u2019s private and has no getter?"
  optionList:
  - Unity makes it public at runtime
  - The field gets copied instead
  - You get a compile-time error
  - It silently fails
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Accessing a private field from another class without a getter results in
    a compile-time error, protecting your code from mistakes.
