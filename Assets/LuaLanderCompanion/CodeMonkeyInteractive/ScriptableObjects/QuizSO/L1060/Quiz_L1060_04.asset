  question: "Why don\u2019t we see log messages from `Debug.Log()` after writing
    them in the script?"
  optionList:
  - "There\u2019s a bug in Unity"
  - The script needs to be compiled
  - "The script isn\u2019t attached to a GameObject"
  - Logs are only visible in play mode
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: "Scripts don\u2019t run unless they\u2019re attached to an active GameObject
    in the scene. Just writing a script isn\u2019t enough, you have to assign it."
