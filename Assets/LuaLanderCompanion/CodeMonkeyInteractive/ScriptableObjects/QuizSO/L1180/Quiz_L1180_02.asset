  question: Why is the `gameObject.SetActive(false)` call placed in `Start()` instead
    of `Awake()`?
  optionList:
  - Because `Start()` runs before `Awake()`.
  - Because UI updates only work in `Start()`.
  - To avoid Unity bugs with game object visibility.
  - To make sure the script can subscribe to events before being disabled.
  correctOptionIndex: 3
  answer: "If you disable a GameObject in `Awake()`, its `Start()` method never runs\u2014so
    event listeners wouldn\u2019t be attached. That\u2019s why you do it in `Start()`."
