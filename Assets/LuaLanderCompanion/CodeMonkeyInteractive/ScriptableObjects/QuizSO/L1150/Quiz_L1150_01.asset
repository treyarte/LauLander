  question: Why should you multiply fuel consumption by `Time.deltaTime`?
  optionList:
  - To make the game faster
  - To reduce lag during gameplay
  - To make fuel consumption independent of framerate
  - To avoid using Update method
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Without `Time.deltaTime`, fuel would drain differently depending on your
    framerate. Using it ensures consistent fuel consumption across devices.
