  question: Why should the `DestroySelf` method be placed on the `FuelPickup` script
    instead of the lander?
  optionList:
  - Because Unity requires it
  - To keep logic encapsulated within the pickup
  - To use physics properly
  - To save memory
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: Putting `DestroySelf` in the pickup script means each object manages its
    own destruction, another good clean code practice.
