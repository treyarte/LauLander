  question: What happens when `fuelAmount` reaches zero?
  optionList:
  - The lander explodes
  - The player wins
  - Input is ignored, and the lander falls with no control
  - The game resets
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Once fuel is zero, the movement code returns early. No more force is applied,
    and the lander just drops with gravity.
