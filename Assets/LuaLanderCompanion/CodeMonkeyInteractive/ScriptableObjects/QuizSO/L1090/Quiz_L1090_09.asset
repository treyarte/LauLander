  question: "What is the result of manually modifying the Main Camera\u2019s settings
    after adding Cinemachine?"
  optionList:
  - It crashes Unity
  - It creates a second camera
  - Nothing happens, the settings are overridden
  - The camera detaches from the scene
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Once Cinemachine is active, changes to the Main Camera are ignored because
    it's now controlled by the Virtual Camera.
