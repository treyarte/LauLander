  question: What does the question mark (`?.`) in `OnUpForce?.Invoke(...)` mean?
  optionList:
  - It's a typo
  - It's the null coalescing operator
  - It's a comment
  - It's the null conditional operator
  correctOptionIndex: 3
  answer: The `?.` checks if the event has any listeners (is not null) before trying
    to invoke it, which prevents errors from trying to call a null event with no
    listeners.
