  question: Why did we create a separate `LanderVisuals` script instead of putting
    the thruster logic into the main Lander script?
  optionList:
  - To reduce file size
  - To avoid Unity errors
  - To separate logic from visuals and keep code clean
  - Because Unity doesn't allow particle code in main scripts
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Separating logic from visuals is a clean code practice. The Lander logic
    handles physics and input, while visuals go in their own script to avoid messy
    code and coupling.
