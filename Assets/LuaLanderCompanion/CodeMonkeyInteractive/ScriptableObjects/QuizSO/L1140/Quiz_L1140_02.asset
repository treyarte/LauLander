  question: How are the thruster particle systems turned on and off?
  optionList:
  - By enabling/disabling the GameObject
  - By enabling/disabling the Renderer
  - By controlling the emission module
  - By setting the alpha of the sprite
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: We use the `.emission.enabled` property on each `ParticleSystem` to start
    or stop it. This gives us precise control over when particles spawn.
