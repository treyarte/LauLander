  question: "What setting ensures the rope segments don\u2019t rotate uncontrollably?"
  optionList:
  - Making them static
  - Enabling angle limits on the HingeJoint2D
  - Setting the Rigidbody2D to Dynamic
  - Disabling interpolation
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: By enabling angle limits (e.g., -20 to +20 degrees), the rope segments
    can only rotate within a defined range. This prevents them from spinning wildly
    and keeps the movement looking like a natural swinging rope.
