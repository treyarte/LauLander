  question: How is the cargo picked up in the game?
  optionList:
  - By colliding with the crate
  - By pressing a key over the pickup zone
  - By hovering over the CargoArea trigger zone for a few seconds
  - By clicking on the cargo
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: "The player must stay within the CargoArea\u2019s trigger collider for
    a set amount of time. During that time, a timer counts up. Once the timer completes,
    the crate is spawned and attached to the lander. This mechanic introduces a brief
    'charging' interaction rather than an instant pickup."
