  question: How is the cargo transported with physics?
  optionList:
  - It is parented to the lander directly
  - It uses Rigidbody2D with BoxCollider2D and is connected via HingeJoint2D
  - It follows the lander using transform position
  - "It\u2019s animated via Animator"
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: The cargo crate is connected to the rope using another HingeJoint2D. The
    crate has its own Rigidbody2D and BoxCollider2D, which allows it to be fully
    simulated by Unity's 2D physics system. This creates a realistic swinging behavior
    as the lander moves.
