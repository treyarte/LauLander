  question: What happens if the crate collides with anything other than the lander?
  optionList:
  - It bounces off
  - It plays a sound and gives points
  - The game resets
  - The game triggers a crash (game over)
  correctOptionIndex: 3
  answer: In the crate script, the game listens for collisions. If the crate collides
    with something other than the lander, it triggers a game-over state using CargoCrashed(),
    as the cargo is considered destroyed.
