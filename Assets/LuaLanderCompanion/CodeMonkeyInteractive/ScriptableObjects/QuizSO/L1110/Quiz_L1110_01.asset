  question: What Unity function detects when two 2D physics objects collide?
  optionList:
  - OnCollisionEnter2D
  - OnCollisionEnter
  - OnTriggerEnter2D
  - FixedUpdate
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: The OnCollisionEnter2D function is triggered as soon as a collision happens
    between two objects. You also have OnCollisionExit2D when the collision stops,
    and OnCollisionStay2D that keeps firing on every single Update for as long as
    the two objects are touching.
