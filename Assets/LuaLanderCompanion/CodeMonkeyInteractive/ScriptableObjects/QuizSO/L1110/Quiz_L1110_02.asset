  question: Which Unity component property is used to determine the speed of impact
    during a collision?
  optionList:
  - transform.velocity.magnitude
  - collision.relativeVelocity.magnitude
  - rigidbody.speed
  - Time.deltaTime
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: collision.relativeVelocity gives us the relative velocity involved in the
    collision, which in this case since the Terrain is static is just the Lander
    velocity. Then the magnitude converts that Vector2 into a simple float.
