  question: Why should you avoid using numbers like 4f or .87f directly in if-statements?
  optionList:
  - They slow down performance
  - Magic numbers make the code harder to understand and maintain
  - "Unity doesn\u2019t allow floating point comparisons"
  - It makes the game crash
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: You should never use magic numbers because they are unexplained and take
    time to read and understand. Instead make local variables with good descriptive
    names that make it easily clear what the number is used for.
