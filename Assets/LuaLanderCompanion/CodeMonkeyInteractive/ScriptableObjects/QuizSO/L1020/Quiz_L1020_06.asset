  question: If you create a script that inherits from MonoBehaviour, what does that
    mean?
  optionList:
  - "The script won\u2019t work in Unity"
  - It cannot be attached to GameObjects
  - It can be used as a component
  - It only runs in Play Mode
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Inheriting from MonoBehaviour means Unity will treat the script as a valid
    component you can attach to objects. Without MonoBehaviour you cannot attach
    the script to a Game Object.
