  question: What happens if you open the project in a different Unity version than
    recommended?
  optionList:
  - Everything looks and works exactly the same
  - Unity will crash
  - Some settings, menus, or behaviors might differ
  - The game will automatically update to the new version
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Even if the differences are small, mismatched versions can lead to UI changes
    or subtle bugs, which can be quite confusing for beginners. That's why I recommend
    you use the exact same project as me so that you have the exact same setup.
