  question: When does the turret fire a bullet at the player?
  optionList:
  - As soon as the level starts
  - Every frame regardless of player position
  - Only when the player is in range and the shoot timer has elapsed
  - When the turret receives input from the player
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: The turret uses a timer to control its firing rate (every 1.5 seconds)
    and only fires if the player is within range. This keeps the mechanic predictable
    and balanced.
