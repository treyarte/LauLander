  question: What happens if turret bullets are not destroyed after some time?
  optionList:
  - They disappear on their own
  - They get recycled automatically by Unity
  - They keep existing and can cause performance issues
  - They bounce around endlessly
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: "If bullets are not destroyed manually, they accumulate in the scene, increasing
    memory and CPU usage, eventually causing lag or crashes. That\u2019s why the
    bullets are destroyed after 4 seconds."
