  question: How does the turret bullet move after being spawned?
  optionList:
  - It's moved using transform.Translate in Update
  - "It's animated using Unity\u2019s Animator"
  - "It's moved using Rigidbody2D\u2019s linear velocity"
  - It's parented to the player and follows them
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: The `TurretBullet` script uses `bulletRigidbody2D.linearVelocity = moveDirection
    * speed` to move the bullet in the direction the turret aimed when firing. This
    is physics-based movement.
