  question: Why is the turret head a separate GameObject from the base?
  optionList:
  - So we can apply a different texture
  - To make it easier to parent it to the lander
  - To allow it to rotate independently and aim at the player
  - It has to be separate to add a Rigidbody
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Separating the turret head allows it to rotate independently of the base.
    This makes it possible to visually aim the turret at the player while the base
    remains static.
