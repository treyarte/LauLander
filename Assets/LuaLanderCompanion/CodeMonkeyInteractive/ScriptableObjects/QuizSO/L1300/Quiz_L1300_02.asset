  question: What method is used to determine if the turret should aim at the player?
  optionList:
  - Checking if the player is behind the turret
  - Using a fixed timer
  - "Comparing the player\u2019s position to a hardcoded value"
  - Measuring the distance and comparing it to a range limit
  correctOptionIndex: 3
  answer: The `IsPlayerInRange()` method checks if the player is within 20 units
    of the turret by measuring the distance using `Vector2.Distance`. This prevents
    turrets from targeting players across the whole map.
