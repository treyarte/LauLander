  question: Why should you avoid enabling "Collapse" in the Console?
  optionList:
  - It uses more memory
  - It's buggy
  - You might miss repeated logs
  - It hides errors
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Especially as a beginner, seeing repeated logs can help you understand
    how often something is running whereas if you Collapse then you might miss the
    number and think just one log is being printed.
