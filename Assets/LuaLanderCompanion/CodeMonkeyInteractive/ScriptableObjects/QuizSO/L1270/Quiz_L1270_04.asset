  question: What happens if the player tries to drop off the wrong cargo type at
    a drop zone?
  optionList:
  - The drop zone will still accept it
  - The cargo is removed without reward
  - Nothing happens; the timer doesn't increase
  - The game crashes
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: The `CargoArea` checks whether the carried cargo matches the expected type.
    If it doesn't, it ignores the interaction and the timer does not increase.
