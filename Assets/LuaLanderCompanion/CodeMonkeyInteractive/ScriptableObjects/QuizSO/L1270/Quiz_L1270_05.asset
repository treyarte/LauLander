  question: How is the door opened after delivering the correct key cargo?
  optionList:
  - The lander collides with the door
  - The door opens when a timer reaches zero
  - The `Door` script listens to the `CargoArea.OnDroppedOff` event
  - The key is destroyed automatically, and the door script finds the nearest door
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Each `Door` script is linked to a `CargoArea` and listens to its `OnDroppedOff`
    event. When the correct key is delivered, the event triggers the door to open
    via animation.
