  question: What is the main purpose of using ScriptableObjects in this lecture?
  optionList:
  - To store runtime data for cargo pickups
  - To define and manage multiple cargo types as reusable data assets
  - To replace MonoBehaviours for all game logic
  - To load scenes dynamically
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: ScriptableObjects are used to define cargo types (e.g., crate, red key,
    blue key) as project assets. This allows the developer to reuse, reference, and
    manage cargo types easily without hardcoding or duplicating data.
