  question: How does the timer know when to start counting time?
  optionList:
  - It runs continuously in Update.
  - It starts when `GameManager.Start()` is called.
  - The Lander fires a `StateChanged` event, and the GameManager listens for it.
  - It's triggered from the UI script.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: The Lander fires an event when the state changes to `Normal`, and the GameManager
    starts the timer only then.
