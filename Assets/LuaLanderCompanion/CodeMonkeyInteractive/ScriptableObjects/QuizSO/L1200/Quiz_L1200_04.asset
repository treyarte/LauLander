  question: Why didn't `GoToNextLevel()` work properly the first time?
  optionList:
  - The prefab was missing a collider
  - "The scene wasn\u2019t added to the Build Settings"
  - '`levelNumber` was a non-static field and got reset on scene reload'
  - "Unity doesn\u2019t support reloading scenes during runtime"
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Since `levelNumber` was an instance field, it got reset when the GameManager
    was re-instantiated on scene reload.
