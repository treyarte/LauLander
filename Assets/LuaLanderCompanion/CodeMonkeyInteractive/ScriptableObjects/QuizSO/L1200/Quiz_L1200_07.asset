  question: How is the score preserved between levels?
  optionList:
  - By saving it to PlayerPrefs
  - By passing it through scene parameters
  - By making the score field static
  - It is reset on every level intentionally
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Making the score field static ensures it persists between scene reloads,
    just like `levelNumber`.
