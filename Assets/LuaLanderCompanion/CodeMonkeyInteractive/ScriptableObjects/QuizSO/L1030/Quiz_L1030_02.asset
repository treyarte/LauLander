  question: Why might a sprite not show up when dragged into the scene?
  optionList:
  - It has no name
  - "It\u2019s dropped in the Game view"
  - It needs a tag first
  - You need to attach a script to it
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: Dropping sprites into the *Game view* doesn't work, drop them into the
    *Scene view* or *Hierarchy* to position them properly.
