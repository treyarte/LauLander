  question: Why did we choose to create one animation per level instead of per asteroid?
  optionList:
  - Because Unity does not allow multiple animations
  - It allows better control of each asteroid individually
  - To reduce clutter and manage fewer animation files
  - To reuse animations across all games
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Creating one animation per level keeps things simpler and avoids managing
    dozens of separate animations. All asteroid movements are grouped in one place.
