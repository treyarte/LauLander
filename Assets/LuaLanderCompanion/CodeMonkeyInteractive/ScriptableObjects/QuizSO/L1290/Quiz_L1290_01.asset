  question: What component must be added to the Asteroid to make it cause a Game
    Over on collision?
  optionList:
  - Rigidbody2D
  - BoxCollider2D (or any 2D Collider)
  - Trigger Collider
  - NavMeshAgent
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: "The asteroid only needs a solid (non-trigger) 2D collider to interact
    with the Lander\u2019s collision detection system. Since the Lander already handles
    collisions, adding a collider is all that\u2019s needed to make the asteroid
    deadly."
