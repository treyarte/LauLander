  question: What is a potential downside of using one animation timeline for all
    asteroids in a level?
  optionList:
  - "You can\u2019t use any colliders"
  - "The lander won\u2019t detect collisions anymore"
  - All asteroids must share similar timing or some will appear frozen
  - The game will crash
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: When using a shared animation timeline, if some asteroids have much slower
    keyframes than others, they might appear to stop while the animation continues.
    Keeping animation timing consistent ensures smooth movement across all asteroids.
