  question: What happens when the lander collides with a moving asteroid?
  optionList:
  - The asteroid gets destroyed
  - The game restarts automatically
  - The game registers a crash and ends the level
  - The lander bounces off
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Just like terrain or walls, asteroids are treated as deadly obstacles.
    If the lander collides with one, the crash logic runs and the game ends.
