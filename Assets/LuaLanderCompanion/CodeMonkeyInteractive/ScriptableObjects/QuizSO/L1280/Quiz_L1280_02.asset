  question: How does the WindZone detect when the lander is inside it?
  optionList:
  - By checking collision layers
  - Using a `BoxCollider2D` set as a trigger and `OnTriggerStay2D`
  - By using a raycast
  - Through the Update method
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: WindZones use a `BoxCollider2D` with `isTrigger` enabled and detect the
    lander with `OnTriggerStay2D`. This allows continuous application of force while
    the lander stays inside.
