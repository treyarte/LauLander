  question: What does `Time.timeScale = 0f` do in Unity?
  optionList:
  - Pauses all gameplay and UI interactions
  - Stops all time-based updates including physics and `Time.deltaTime`
  - Only pauses the physics engine
  - Speeds up the game
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: Time.timeScale is multiplied onto Time.deltaTime to get the final result,
    so if it's 0 then all deltaTime will be 0 which will make everything not move.
