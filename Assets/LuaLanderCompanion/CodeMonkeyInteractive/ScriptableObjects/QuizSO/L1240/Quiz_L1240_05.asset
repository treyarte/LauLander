  question: Why do we call `GameManager.ResetStaticData()` when starting a new game
    from the Main Menu?
  optionList:
  - To clear memory leaks
  - To ensure the player always starts from level 1 with 0 score
  - To initialize gamepad support
  - To restart the Input System
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: We have some static data which means it does not get reset automatically,
    so we need to manually reset it ourselves when starting a new game.
