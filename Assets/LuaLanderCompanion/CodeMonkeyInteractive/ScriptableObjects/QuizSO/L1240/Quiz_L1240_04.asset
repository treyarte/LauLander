  question: "What\u2019s the purpose of making `scoreTotal` and `levelNumber` static
    in `GameManager`?"
  optionList:
  - To make them editable from any GameObject
  - To reset them automatically at game start
  - To persist their values across scene loads
  - To allow multiple scores to be tracked
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: If they were not static then they would reset upon scene loading. Since
    we want them to persist we need to make them static.
