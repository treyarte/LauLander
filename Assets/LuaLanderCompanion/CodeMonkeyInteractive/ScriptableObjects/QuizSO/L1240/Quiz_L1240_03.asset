  question: How do we trigger pause/unpause using the Input System?
  optionList:
  - By reading the Escape key state manually
  - By checking for a double tap on the screen
  - By assigning a `Menu` action and hooking into the `performed` event
  - Through the default Unity pause system
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: We did it the proper way by creating a new Action and assigning that action
    to both Keyboard and Gamepad bindings.
