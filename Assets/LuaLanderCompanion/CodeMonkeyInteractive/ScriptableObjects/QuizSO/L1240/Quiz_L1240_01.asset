  question: Why do we use an `enum` in the `SceneLoader` instead of raw strings or
    integers?
  optionList:
  - To avoid using magic strings or build indices that are error-prone
  - Because Unity does not support string-based scene loading
  - So we can load multiple scenes at once
  - To enable drag-and-drop scene selection in the editor
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: Like I've mentioned several times you should avoid strings as much as possible
    since they are so easy to make mistakes. In this case we cannot 100% avoid strings
    but by using an Enum we can avoid it in our own code.
