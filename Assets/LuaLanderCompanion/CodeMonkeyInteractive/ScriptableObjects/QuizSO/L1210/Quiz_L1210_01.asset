  question: What is the primary reason for adding a zoomed-out view at the start
    of each level?
  optionList:
  - To increase the difficulty of the game
  - To allow the player to see the entire level and plan their path
  - To show off the Unity camera features
  - To reduce lag at the beginning of the level
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: The zoomed-out view helps players see the whole map so they can decide
    where to land and plan their strategy, whether to go for an easy or risky landing
    zone.
