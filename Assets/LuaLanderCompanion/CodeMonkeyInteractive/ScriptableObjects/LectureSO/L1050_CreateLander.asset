  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: Create Lander</h1>\r\n\r\nIn this lecture,
    we created the player object, the lander, and did it properly by separating visuals
    from logic. Instead of just dragging the sprite and slapping physics on it, we
    made a clean setup using an empty parent GameObject named \"Lander\" for logic,
    and added the sprite as a child for visuals. This way, any visual changes (like
    resizing or swapping sprites) won\u2019t mess with the game\u2019s logic.\r\n\r\nWe
    added a Rigidbody2D to the parent to enable physics, and just like that, the
    lander starts falling with gravity. To make it interact with the world, we added
    a BoxCollider2D to the lander and set up a floor with another BoxCollider2D.
    This got basic collisions working.\r\n\r\nOne important tip covered here: always
    use the 2D versions of physics components in 2D games. Mixing 2D and 3D colliders
    or rigidbodies causes physics to break since those two systems are completely
    separate, so double-check your components if things act weird.\r\n\r\nWe also
    tweaked the collider size to match the visual, making it a bit smaller for more
    forgiving gameplay. With this setup, the lander falls and lands perfectly. Next
    up, we\u2019ll write some code to give it player controls!\r\n"
