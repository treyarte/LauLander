  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: Cargo Transport</h1>\r\n\r\nIn this lecture,
    we added a fun new gameplay mechanic\u2014cargo transport! We started by importing
    a crate sprite and built a rope system using a chain of `Rigidbody2D` objects
    connected with `HingeJoint2D`. The lander picks up the cargo from a designated
    area by hovering over it for a few seconds, tracked using a timer and `OnTriggerStay2D`.
    Once picked up, the crate dangles using physics, and we handle all the logic
    cleanly through events and modular scripts.\r\n\r\nWe made sure the crate is
    sensitive to collisions\u2014if it hits anything, it triggers a crash just like
    a failed landing. To drop it off, the player flies to another zone and hovers
    for a few seconds. We reused the same `CargoArea` script with a new enum to differentiate
    pickup and drop-off zones. For UI feedback, we used a world-space `Canvas` with
    a radial fill to visually show the progress timer. Finally, we hooked up a level-specific
    script that gives a bonus score when the cargo is successfully delivered.\r\n\r\nThe
    whole system is clean, modular, and fully physics-based\u2014feels super satisfying!
    Next up, we\u2019ll build on this mechanic to create a key-and-door system.\r\n"
