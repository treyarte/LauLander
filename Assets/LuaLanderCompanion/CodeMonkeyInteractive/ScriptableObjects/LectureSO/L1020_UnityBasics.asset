  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: Unity Basics</h1>\r\n\r\nIn this lecture,
    we went over all the Unity basics, perfect if you're just getting started. I
    explained how Unity is built around scenes and game objects, and how every game
    object is made up of components like a camera or a 2D light. We looked at the
    Hierarchy window to view all objects in the current scene, and the Inspector
    to see and modify their components. You learned how to create new game objects
    like sprites, position them in the scene, and even organize them into parent-child
    hierarchies.\r\n\r\nI also covered the Project window where all your game files
    live, how to add assets, and how to create and attach custom C# scripts as components.
    We saw how to navigate the Scene View, toggle between 2D and 3D, and use shortcuts
    like pressing **F** to focus on an object. Then we looked at the Console, how
    to log messages with `Debug.Log()`, and the importance of making sure all message
    types are visible.\r\n\r\nSo now you understand the basics of how Unity works,
    and you\u2019re ready to start building something. Next up, let\u2019s import
    some visuals to make our game look awesome!\r\n\r\n"
