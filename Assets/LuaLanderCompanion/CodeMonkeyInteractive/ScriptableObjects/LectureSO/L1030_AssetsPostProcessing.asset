  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: Import Assets, Post processing, Background</h1>\r\n\r\nIn
    this lecture, we imported the visual and audio assets we'll be using for the
    game. I walked you through how to drag the provided `.unitypackage` into Unity
    and import everything in one go. Once imported, all the assets were already properly
    set up, so no need to mess with import settings just yet.\r\n\r\nWe then dropped
    in a few sprites, like the lander, background, fuel, and coin, just to get a
    look at things and make sure they appear in the scene. I also tweaked the global
    light intensity a bit for a nicer starting look.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we set up
    post processing to give our game some nice visual polish right from the start.
    I created a global volume and added effects like **Bloom** to give things a glowing
    look, and **Vignette** to subtly darken the screen corners for that space-game
    feel. We also made sure to enable post processing on the camera to actually see
    the changes.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s all just visual, so feel free to tweak the effects
    to your liking. The main goal here was to get our project looking clean and ready
    for building. All set for the next step!\r\n"
