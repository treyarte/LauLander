  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: Turrets</h1>\n\nIn this lecture, we added
    some awesome turrets to make the levels more dangerous and exciting! These turrets
    track the player\u2019s position and shoot bullets that the player needs to dodge\u2014otherwise,
    it's game over.\n\nWe started by importing the turret assets and building a proper
    turret GameObject with separate base and head objects. This allowed the head
    to rotate independently and aim at the player using some basic vector math. To
    prevent them from shooting across the map, we added a range check so the turret
    only activates when the lander is nearby.\n\nNext, we made the bullets. They're
    simple prefabs with a Rigidbody2D and a collider, and we control their movement
    using a TurretBullet script that applies velocity in the aim direction. We also
    added a timer to make sure bullets get destroyed after a few seconds so they
    don\u2019t pile up and cause lag.\n\nWith all that done, we placed a few turrets
    in the level, tested it, and yup\u2014everything worked perfectly. They aim,
    shoot, and force the player to stay alert and maneuver carefully.\n\nAlright
    awesome!"
