  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: Levels</h1>\r\n\r\nIn this lecture, we
    implemented support for multiple levels in our Lunar Lander game. Instead of
    creating separate scenes for each level, we took the cleaner and more modular
    approach of using prefabs. Each level is now a prefab containing the terrain,
    landing pads, and a special `LanderStartPosition` transform to define the player's
    starting point.\r\n\r\nWe created a `GameLevel` script to store level-specific
    data like the level number and the start position. Then, on the `GameManager`,
    we loaded the correct level by looping through a list of all level prefabs and
    instantiating the one matching the current level number. The lander was then
    positioned at that level\u2019s designated start point.\r\n\r\nTo move between
    levels, we hooked up the continue button in the `LandedUI` to either retry the
    current level or load the next one. To make that work, we made the `levelNumber`
    field static, allowing it to persist between scene reloads. Same with `score`,
    also made static so your progress carries across levels.\r\n\r\nNow we can easily
    create new levels by duplicating a prefab and customizing its layout. Everything
    is dynamic and clean. In the next lecture, we\u2019ll add a nice camera zoom-out
    so the player can preview the full level before playing.\r\n"
