  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: Moving Obstacles</h1>\n\nIn this lecture,
    we added some classic danger: moving obstacles! Specifically, we built a bunch
    of deadly asteroids that move around and force the player to dodge them while
    trying to land safely.\n\nWe started by importing some asteroid sprites and quickly
    set up a basic static obstacle with a collider. Thanks to our clean project structure
    and existing collision logic, touching it already results in a game over\u2014super
    easy.\n\nThen we made things interesting by animating the asteroids. Instead
    of scripting movement, we used Unity\u2019s Animator system to keep things simple
    and visual. We grouped all the asteroids under a single AsteroidObjects_Level1
    GameObject and made one big animation that moves them left and right. This way,
    we didn\u2019t need separate animations for each asteroid.\n\nWe added multiple
    asteroids with similar animation timings to keep everything looking smooth, and
    just like that, we had a level full of moving death-traps. The result? A much
    more exciting level that really tests the player\u2019s flying skills.\n\nClean
    code, good structure, and smart use of Unity features made this one super quick
    to implement. Alright, awesome!"
