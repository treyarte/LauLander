  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: Touch Input, Buttons and Joystick</h1>\r\n\r\nIn
    this lecture, we added full touch input support to our game using Unity\u2019s
    Input System, and we covered two different approaches, on-screen buttons and
    a joystick. Since our input is already handled through proper Input Actions,
    adding new input methods was super easy.\r\n\r\nFirst, we built three simple
    transparent UI buttons, Up, Left, and Right, and used Unity\u2019s built-in `OnScreenButton`
    component to emulate key presses. That worked great and let us control the game
    with touch instantly. We also tested using Unity\u2019s Device Simulator to simulate
    a mobile device and verified everything worked as expected.\r\n\r\nThen we went
    one step further and added an on-screen joystick. For this, we created a new
    `Movement` action set to `Value` with a `Vector2` type, which allows for full
    2D directional input. We exposed that through our `GameInput` class, updated
    the lander logic to respond to joystick movement, and set up an `OnScreenJoystick`
    component on a new UI element. And just like that, boom, full joystick control
    on mobile!\r\n\r\nSo now we\u2019ve got full support for keyboard, gamepad, and
    mobile touch input. Clean, flexible, and super powerful!\r\n"
