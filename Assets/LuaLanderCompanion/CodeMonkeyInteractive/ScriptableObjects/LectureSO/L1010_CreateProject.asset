  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: Create Project, Unity 6, URP 2D, Layout</h1>\r\n\r\nIn
    this lecture, we kicked off the Lunar Lander project by setting up Unity and
    preparing a clean working environment. I used Unity 6.1 with the Universal Render
    Pipeline (URP) and 2D Renderer, perfect for this kind of game. I recommended
    just watching these setup lectures first and then downloading the official project
    files to ensure everything matches perfectly with what you\u2019ll see throughout
    the course.\r\n\r\nWe went over setting up a clean editor layout, including positioning
    the Inspector, Hierarchy, Project window, and Console for maximum efficiency.
    I also tweaked some preferences like enabling VSync, setting the aspect ratio
    to 16:9, and adjusting Console settings for better debugging. Finally, I mentioned
    I\u2019ll be using Visual Studio 2022 for coding, but you're free to use any
    IDE you prefer.\r\n\r\nSo now the project is ready, and we\u2019re good to go!
    Let\u2019s move on and look into the Unity basics.\r\n\r\n"
