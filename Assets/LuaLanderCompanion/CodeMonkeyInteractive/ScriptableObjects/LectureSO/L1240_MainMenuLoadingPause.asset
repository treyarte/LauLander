  lectureDescription: '<h1>Lecture Summary: Main Menu, Loading, Pause, Gamepad button
    clicks</h1>



    In this lecture, we made our Lunar Lander game feel like a
    real, complete game by adding a proper main menu, pause menu, and game over screen,
    plus full gamepad support for all UI navigation and interaction.



    We started
    by building a simple `MainMenuScene` with a play and quit button, and hooked
    them up with a new `SceneLoader` static class. Instead of relying on string or
    index-based scene loading (which can get messy), we made a clean enum system
    for scene names, much safer and easier to manage.



    Next, we implemented
    a pause menu with `Time.timeScale = 0f` to stop the game and resume when the
    menu button (Escape or gamepad Start) is pressed. Input was handled using the
    new Input System, with proper action bindings and clean events.



    We also
    created a `GameOverScene` that shows the final score and lets the player return
    to the main menu. To track progress between levels, we used static variables,
    but since those persist between scenes, we added a `ResetStaticData()` method
    to clean everything up when starting a new game.



    Everything works with
    both keyboard and gamepad, including navigating menus and pressing buttons. The
    game is now fully playable start to finish, with all the polish you''d expect!
