  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: Setup Complete, Download Project Files</h1>\r\n\r\nIn
    this lecture, I explained how to get your project set up to match mine exactly
    by downloading the full project files. This way, you\u2019ll avoid all the common
    issues I see, like using the wrong Unity version, a different render pipeline,
    or mismatched package settings. It keeps everything clean, simple, and in sync.\r\n\r\nJust
    scroll down the lecture page, download the provided `.zip` file, and extract
    it somewhere on your PC. Then open Unity Hub, choose \u201CAdd project from disk,\u201D
    and select the folder. If you don\u2019t have the Unity version I\u2019m using,
    Unity Hub will prompt you to install it, go ahead and do that.\r\n\r\nOnce it\u2019s
    loaded, you\u2019ll have the exact same scene, setup, and assets that I\u2019m
    using throughout the course. That means no surprises and no debugging weird version-specific
    issues.\r\n\r\nAlright, your project is now fully set up and ready to go. In
    the next lecture, we\u2019ll take a look at the companion project, which is super
    helpful as you go through the course. Let\u2019s get to it!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
