  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: Score Multiplier</h1>\r\n\r\nIn this
    lecture, we made our scoring system even more fun by adding score multipliers
    to different landing pads. We started by updating the `LandingPad` script to
    include a private `scoreMultiplier` field, exposed in the Inspector using `[SerializeField]`
    for editor editing while still keeping it safe from other scripts. Then we created
    prefab variants of our landing pad, each with its own size and multiplier, like
    a small one that gives 5x the score.\r\n\r\nTo read the multiplier, we added
    a public getter method in the `LandingPad` script. This kept the variable private
    but still allowed us to safely access it when calculating the final landing score.\r\n\r\nThen
    we added a dynamic visual to display the multiplier directly on the landing pad.
    We created a new `LandingPadVisual` script, gave it a reference to a TextMeshPro
    component, and updated the text on `Awake()` by grabbing the multiplier from
    the logic script. This was a great example of keeping logic and visuals separate,
    clean code all the way!\r\n\r\nNow we\u2019ve got multiple pads, unique multipliers,
    and clear visual indicators. Everything\u2019s working great. Next, we\u2019ll
    add some nice thruster visuals to really bring the lander to life!\r\n"
