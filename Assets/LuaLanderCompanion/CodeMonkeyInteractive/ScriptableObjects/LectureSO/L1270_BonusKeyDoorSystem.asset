  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: Key Door System</h1>\n\nIn this lecture,
    we built a key and door system using our existing cargo transport mechanic and
    learned about a super useful Unity feature\u2014ScriptableObjects. We started
    by importing new visual assets and creating a CargoSO class to define different
    cargo types like crates and colored keys. ScriptableObjects are awesome because
    they store data as Unity assets, making them perfect for this kind of flexible
    system.\n\nWe updated our CargoArea to support pickup/drop-off of specific cargo
    types, and refactored the Lander to carry a CargoSO reference. Visuals now show
    what cargo is being carried, and only matching types can be dropped off.\n\nThen
    we built animated doors that open when the correct key is delivered. We used
    a simple Animator with boolean transitions and a new Door script that listens
    for the cargo drop-off event.\n\nThe result is a really flexible, reusable key-door
    system that can support any number of keys and door combinations. We covered
    some important concepts like clean architecture, ScriptableObjects, and Unity
    animation\u2014all while building something fun and super useful for all kinds
    of games!"
