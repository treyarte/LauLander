  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: Landing Pad</h1>\r\n\r\nIn this lecture,
    we created a proper Landing Pad and added score calculation for successful landings.
    First, we built the Landing Pad GameObject with clean separation between logic
    and visuals, an empty parent for logic, and a sliced sprite for visuals so we
    can scale it horizontally without stretching the edges.\r\n\r\nWe also discussed
    a super important concept: how to **identify objects** in a clean and safe way.
    Many tutorials rely on names or tags to identify objects, but that\u2019s really
    bad practice because strings are fragile and hard to debug. Instead, we used
    a component-based approach. We created a simple `LandingPad` script and added
    it to the Landing Pad object. Then, in our landing logic, we used `TryGetComponent<LandingPad>()`
    to check if the object we landed on is actually a landing pad. Super clean and
    error-proof.\r\n\r\nFinally, we used our landing angle and speed checks to calculate
    a score. We built a formula that rewards smoother and more upright landings with
    higher scores. So now we\u2019ve got proper detection, a visual landing pad,
    and scoring, all working great!\r\n\r\nNext up, we\u2019ll support multiple landing
    pads with different score multipliers.\r\n"
