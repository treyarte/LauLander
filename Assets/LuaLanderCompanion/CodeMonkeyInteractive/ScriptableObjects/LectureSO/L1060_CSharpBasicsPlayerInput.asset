  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: C# Basics, Player Input</h1>\r\n\r\nIn
    this lecture, we created our first custom script to control the lander and learned
    the basics of C# and Unity\u2019s scripting flow. We started by creating a clean
    `Scripts` folder, then added a new `Lander` MonoBehaviour script and attached
    it to the logic (parent) GameObject, keeping logic and visuals separated.\r\n\r\nWe
    covered how `Start()` runs once and `Update()` runs every frame, and emphasized
    good coding practices like always explicitly writing access modifiers (`private`,
    `public`, etc.) even if the default works.\r\n\r\nNext, we jumped into handling
    player input. We explored Unity\u2019s two input systems, the legacy Input Manager
    and the newer Input System. While the old one is simpler, we\u2019ll be using
    the Input System in this course for its added flexibility.\r\n\r\nWe tested for
    input using `Keyboard.current.upArrowKey.isPressed` to detect key presses each
    frame, and showed how it compares to the legacy method using `Input.GetKey()`.
    With the up, left, and right keys all being tracked, we now have the basic input
    system working.\r\n\r\nIn the next lecture, we\u2019ll take this input and apply
    some physics to actually move the lander around!\r\n"
